# Riot Google maps

> Google Maps tags for Riot.js

This repository take inspiration from the [react-google-maps](https://github.com/tomchentw/react-google-maps) repo but to be used with the smaller [riotjs](http://riotjs.com/) framework.

It's still a work in progress and more tags will be added further on. For now the following riotjs tags are available:

* ```<google-map>```
* ```<marker>```
* ```<search-box>```
